Sure! Here's an example of a README file for a React.js project that implements a to-do list:

# React To-Do List

This project is a simple to-do list application built using React.js. It allows users to access the tasks list, add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Save" button to add it to the to-do list.
- Edit tasks: Click on the Edit icon (pencil icon) next to a task to edit it and save it into the same list.
- Delete tasks: Click on the delete icon (trash can) next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Tasks list: The application displays all the tasks started from the top of the list.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tecguri/todolist.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todolist`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
react-to-do-list/
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    logo192.png
    logo512.png
    manifest.json
    robots.txt
  src/
    components/
      List.js
